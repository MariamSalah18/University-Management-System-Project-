# University-Management-System-Project

Project Description:
This project involves the development of a comprehensive course registration and management system. The system utilizes a suitable data structure to store detailed information about various courses, including their names, codes, requirements (e.g., prerequisites or elective status), maximum number of students, pre-required courses, hours, and instructors. By considering these factors, the system determines the eligibility of students to enroll in desired courses.
To ensure data persistence and easy access, the system incorporates file management. Separate files are utilized to store and retrieve course information, student details, feedback, and generate reports. This approach guarantees the system's efficiency and facilitates seamless information management.
The system provides an array of functionalities to both students and the system administrator. Students can log in to the system and gain access to a comprehensive list of available courses. They can filter the courses based on their preferences, view detailed information about each course, and register for eligible courses. Furthermore, students can keep track of their enrolled courses, check their grades, and access their cumulative GPA. The system also allows students to modify their personal data, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.
The system administrator possesses the authority to remove students or courses from the system as needed. This capability ensures accurate record-keeping and facilitates efficient student and course management.
The system generates comprehensive reports on courses, presenting key statistics such as the number of students enrolled, average grades, and other relevant metrics. These reports offer valuable insights to the system administrator, aiding in the monitoring of course performance and decision-making processes.
By enforcing prerequisite requirements, the system ensures that students can only register for courses they are eligible for. Through the organization and storage of course data and student information, the system optimizes the course registration process and effectively tracks students' academic progress. The inclusion of file management capabilities, feedback functionality, removal features, and course reports further enhances the system's functionality and provides valuable administrative insights. Overall, this project streamlines course registration procedures, facilitates efficient student management, and enables informed decision-making through reports and feedback mechanisms.
